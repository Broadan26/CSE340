# CSE340

## Project 1

Develop a lexer. The lexer can determine different types of statements. Statements that need to be implemented are REALNUMBERS, BASE08NUMBERS, BASE16NUMBERS.

## Project 2

Develop a parser. The parser can parse a given grammar and check for exceptions or errors as they come up.

## Project 3

Developer a lexer and a parser. A combination of Project 1 and 2, a lexer needs to have changes made to handle REALNUMBERS. The parser has a more complicated grammar than was implemented in project 2.
